# **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist**

This is a data science project based on the "Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist" available on **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)**. The dataset contains information on customer orders, payments, reviews, and product descriptions for thousands of online transactions made at Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform.

## **Project Overview**

This project consists of three parts:

1. **Understanding Business and Data Using SQL:** This part involves exploring the dataset using SQL queries to understand the business context and identify relevant variables for predicting customer satisfaction.
2. **Data Manipulation and Visualization:** In this part, we clean and organize the dataset, create visualizations to better understand the relationships between variables, and identify patterns in the data.
3. **Satisfaction Prediction:** The final part of the project involves training machine learning models to predict customer satisfaction based on the review score. We use data preprocessing techniques, cross-validation, and hyperparameter optimization to ensure that our models are well-tuned and optimized for the dataset.

## **Conclusion**

By completing this project, we gain a better understanding of how e-commerce operates in Brazil, as well as the importance of customer satisfaction for a successful online business. We also gain hands-on experience in data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning modeling.
